# Computational Workflows
## Doctoral Programme in Science and Engineering (DSSE)

### Practicalities

Instructor: Jack S. Hale (jack.hale@uni.lu). Office hours: 1500-1600 Wednesdays (by appointment).

Course Room: MNO 1.010.

Date: Friday 17th September 0900 - 1200 and 1315 - 1700.

### Description

This one day course covers the basics of Computational Workflows for Scientific
Computing.  During the course we will discuss *acheivable* best practice for
performing Scientific Computing, and we will discover some tools (containers,
unit testing and continuous integration) that can help.


### Useful information

* Due to room limitations the 2021 edition of the course must run under the
  [CovidCheck system](https://covid19.public.lu/en/covidcheck.html).  If you
  are vaccinated or recovered, please bring your EU Digital Covid Certificate.
  If you want to take a lateral flow test on-site, please contact me via email
  as soon as possible and turn up at 0845 so that we have time to organise the
  test.

* Assumed knowledge: basic git, basic Python, basic Linux administration
  (shell, installing software from package managers etc.).

* The Etherpad for the 2021 edition is at: https://pad.carpentries.org/cwul2021.
  The Etherpad is public, please use a pseudonym and do not reveal any personal
  information.

### Prior to the day of the course
