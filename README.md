### Practicalities

Instructor: Jack S. Hale (jack.hale@uni.lu). Office hours: 1500-1600 Wednesdays (by appointment).

Course Room: MNO 1.030.

Date: Thursday 10th November 2022 0900 - 1200 and 1315 - 1700.

### Description

This one day course covers the basics of Computational Workflows for Scientific
Computing.  During the course we will discuss *acheivable* best practice for
performing Scientific Computing, and we will discover some tools (containers,
unit testing and continuous integration) that can help.

### Outline

* Introduction to Good Practice in Scientific Computing.
* Specifying and running software anywhere with Docker.
* Unit testing software with Python and pytest.
* Continuous integration using GitHub Actions.

### Useful information

* Assumed knowledge: [basic
  git](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf),
  [basic Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython), [basic
  Linux administration](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (shell,
  installing software from package managers etc.). Please refresh your knowledge
  prior to the course if you are feeling unsure.

* [The Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/cwul2022). We will use the
  Etherpad for technical questions and for sharing information during the
  course. The Etherpad is public, please use a pseudonym and do not reveal any
  personal information.

### Prior to the day of the course

1. Please download and read the paper [Good enough practices in Scientific
   Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
   We will use and discuss the paper during the class.

2. Install Docker on your personal computer following the instructions
   [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Windows, Mac and Linux are
   supported. Please verify that you can run the following command before the
   day of the course:

       docker run -it hello-world

   If you are having difficulties please contact me via the
   [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/cwul2021).

3. See if you have the version control system `git` installed:

       git --version

   If not, then please install it following the instructions
   [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. Get an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).


### Assessment

A coursework will be distributed at the end of the class. To pass the course and
receive the ECTS credits you must complete the coursework.
